## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>
<br>
The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `DoctorlistPanel`, `AppointmentListPanel`, `TimeSlotListPanel`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person`, `Appointment`, `Doctor`, and `TimeSlot` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add patient feature

#### Implementation

This feature deals with adding a patient to the health records database.

The fields required when adding a patient are the patient's
* `Name`
* `Age`
* `Gender`
* `Ethnicity`
* `Nric`
* `Phone`
* `Email`
* `Address`

This feature is facilitated by the `Person` class and the `UniquePersonList`, which extends Iterable<Person>
and ensures all the Persons in this list is unique.
The `Person` class stores the required fields of the patient.

**The Specifics**

`AddCommandParser` parses the user-inputted command and creates a `Person` object
with its required fields, as well as an `AddCommand` that adds this person into the `Model`.
This `Person` is added into the `UniquePersonList`.

### Add Appointment feature

#### Implementation

The system facilitates the add appointment mechanism through the `UniqueAppointmentList` and `Appointment` Class. `UniqueAppointmentList`, extending `Iterable<Appointment>`, ensures all appointments are unique, akin to the operations in `UniquePersonList`.
The Appointment class encapsulates crucial appointment data: description, date (inclusive of time), associated doctor's name, and the patient.

The delete Appointment command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls deleteAppointment(INDEX), which deletes the Appointment from the system by their Index.

**Note:** The command will fail if the `INDEX` provided is out of bounds, either less than 1 or exceeding the number of appointments in the list.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: storage of Appointments**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Appointment is its own class containing detailed information on the appointment.
    * Pros: Aligned with the approach for patients. Easier to build upon for future implementations.
    * Cons: May introduce complexities and higher lines of code.

* **Alternative 2:** Appointments as strings in an ArrayList.
    * Pros: Simpler implementation.
    * Cons: Less adaptable for future developments involving the Appointment Class.

### Delete Patient

#### Implementation

Our delete patient mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteCommand` and the `LogicManager` Class.
User can enter `delete 3` which deletes all information, including appointments and details, of the person in the list.
The following sequence diagram shows how the DeleteCommand class works.

<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000px">
The above shows the sequence diagram of the feature of Delete Patient.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** 
* The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
* If the index of patient to be deleted is **less than 1** or **exceeds the number of patients in the List** then DeleteCommand is going to fail.
</box>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How convenient it is for clinic staff to delete:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete based on `index` shown on the present list
    * Pros: Intuitive and easy for nurse to delete
    * Cons: Needs to use zero-based indexing since lists are zero-indexed but the view of clinic staff is one-indexed.

* **Alternative 2:** Delete based on `name` of patient
    * Pros: Will be more accurate when deleting a patient
    * Cons: Takes more time as need to type out names of patient when deleting and length of names may vary from person to person
    * Cons: User will face issues when trying to delete patients with the same name

### Delete Appointment feature

#### Implementation

The delete appointment mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteAppointmentCommand`, `UniqueAppointmentList` and the `LogicManager` Class.
Clinic staff can enter `delete_appt 3` which deletes the appointment at index 3 and the appointment that is stored inside the Patient and Doctor Class.
The following sequence diagram shows how the DeleteAppointmentCommand class works.

**Note:** If the index is not a positive integer and less than the amount of appointments the command will fail.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteAppointments.puml" alt="DeleteAppointment" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How Appointments are being deleted:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Appointment is being stored in 3 different places inside a patient object, a doctor object, and the `UniqueAppointmentList` and are being deleted once at each object.
    * Pros: Easy to understand
    * Cons: Can be easily filled with bugs and takes a lot of effort to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** have only one List of Appointments and by deleting it there everywhere else appointment will be deleted.
    * Pros: Will be harder for bugs to happen.
    * Cons: Will be harder to implement.

### List feature

#### Implementation

The list appointments feature is added on from the `Appointment` class. The `list_appt` command will list out all
appointments in the Clinic Assistant database.

Firstly, to implement the list appointments command, we have to edit the current frontend to add a new Panel to display
the appointments. This is done by adding a new `AppointmentListPanel` class to the `seedu.address.ui` package. This
class is then added to the `MainWindow` class to display the appointments. The `AppointmentCard` class is also added to
display the individual appointments inside the `AppointmentListPanel`. In addition, the corresponding `fxml` files are
also added to the `view` folder to display the appointments.

To implement the backend of the list appointments command, we first have to store the appointments in the database.
Like the implementation of storing of `Person`, we keep a `UniqueAppointmentList` in the `Model` class to store the
appointments. The `UniqueAppointmentList` class is similar to the `UniquePersonList` class, except that it stores
`Appointment` objects instead of `Person` objects. What we show on the frontend is the filtered list of appointments
from the `UniqueAppointmentList` class.

A `ListAppointmentCommand` class is then created to handle the `list_appt` command. This class is similar to the
`ListCommand` class, except that it handles the `Appointment` objects instead of `Person` objects. The
`ListAppointmentCommand` class will then be called by the `LogicManager` class to execute the `list_appt` command.
What this command does is that it changes the predicate to the filtered list of appointments to show all the
appointments in the database.

#### Alternatives considered

**Aspect: How to store and maintain list of appointments:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save the list of appointments as a `UniqueAppointmentList` and filter it when needed.
    * Pros: Easy to implement - similar to the current implementation of `Person`
    * Cons: More memory is used to store the list of appointments

* **Alternative 2:** Get the list of appointments by parsing through each `Person` object in the `UniquePersonList`
    * Pros: Will use less memory
    * Cons: Will be slower because we have to iterate through all the `Person` objects to get the appointments each time

### Find appointments by date feature

#### Implementation

The find appointments by date feature built on the find appointment command. The `find_appt /on` command will list out
all appointments in the Clinic Assistant database that falls on the date given.

To implement the find appointments by date command, we have to update the predicate for the filtered list of
appointments to show on the frontend. We have to add a predicate to check for all the appointments that falls on the
date given.

The find appointment command is extended to take in different parameters and filter the list shown on the frontend
accordingly.

#### Alternatives considered

**Aspect: How to implement the find appointments by date command:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Extend the functionality of the find appointment command to take in different parameters
    * Pros: More user-friendly and allows user to filter by multiple parameters
    * Cons: Harder to implement

* **Alternative 2:** Add a new command to only filter by date
    * Pros: Easier to implement
    * Cons: Users cannot filter by multiple parameters


### Find patient by NRIC feature

#### Implementation

The find patient by NRIC feature will find a patient whose NRIC matches the given NRIC.
This feature is facilitated by the `FindByNricCommandParser` and `FindByNricCommand` classes.
To find a patient using a given NRIC, we have to use this NRIC as a predicate for the list of patients with unique NRICs.
We will compare each patient's NRIC to this given NRIC and return the patient with the matching NRIC.

**The Specifics**

The job of the `FindByNricCommandParser` is to create a `FindByNricCommand` command object,
with a `NricContainsKeywordPredicate` object passed in as a parameter.

The `updateFilteredPersonList` method in the `Model` class is called,
which then calls the `setPredicate` method in the `FilteredList` class,
both with the `NricContainsKeywordPredicate` object passed in as the predicate.


<img src="images/FindByNricSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000px">
The above shows the sequence diagram of the find by NRIC feature.

**Alternatives considered**

**Aspect: How to implement find patient by NRIC feature**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new command that takes in the required NRIC as an argument.
    * Pros: Easy to implement, as it has a structure similar to the original Find command.
    * Cons: If users were to input an erratic NRIC, no matching patients will be shown.
* **Alternative 2:** Extend the pre-existing Find command to accept NRIC as another argument
    * Pros: With more parameters, users can look for more patients at one time.
  Even if the user inputs an erratic NRIC, they can still input the patients name
  and receive a list of possible matching patients to choose from.
    * Cons: This is harder to implement as the FilteredList would have to take in more than 1 type of predicate.

### Edit Appointment feature

#### Implementation

The edit Appointment mechanism is facilitated by the `EditAppointmentDescriptor` class. It's mechanism is similar to that of `EditCommand`'s implementation.
An `edit_appt` command input takes in an Appointment Index, followed by a minimum of 1 required input change of either description `[/d]` or date `[/on]`.

After receiving the users input, the `EditAppointmentCommandParser` parses the given input to form an `EditAppointmentDescriptor`, which will then be used by `createEditedAppointment` to create an Appointment to replace the user specified index.

**Note:** If the Index provided is invalid (0 or bigger than the size of Appointment list), or no input change is given, the command will fail.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How Appointments are going to be edited:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Appointment is Edited based on its Index in the overall Appointment List
    * Pros: One centralized Appointment List for all Edit Appointment operations
    * Cons: Harder to implement

* **Alternative 2:** An additional Index field of the Patients Index is to be given, followed by his/her Appointment to edit
    * Pros: Appointment to be edited is specified to the specific Patient index input
    * Cons: Harder for the user to visualise which Appointment he is going to edit

### View Available Timeslots feature

#### Implementation

The view available timeslots mechanism is facilitated by the `UniqueTimeslotList` and `Timeslot` class.
A `view` command input takes in a `date` and displays all available timeslots for that `date`. This is mainly used by users
to identify available timeslots instantly which they can use to book appointments on.

After receiving the users input, the `ViewAvailableCommandParser` parses the given input to return a `ViewAvailableCommand` instance which will then be executed.

**Note:** If the `date` provided is invalid (**non-existent** (eg 31-02-2024), or **past** (eg 01-01-1900)), the command will fail.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: What Timeslots will be added:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Loop through all appointments in the appointment list and only add timeslots which are available
    * Pros: Allows to retrieve the latest appointments and add available timeslots accurately
    * Cons: Increased coupling between timeslots and appointment

* **Alternative 2:** Add the timeslots taken by appointments directly
    * Pros: Easier to implement as we only need to get time from appointments
    * Cons: Harder for user to visualise exactly which timeslot is available and can be used to book appointments

## **Future Features**

### Edit Doctor

#### Implementation

This enhancement will let the user edit details of the doctor inside the clinic assistant without deleting or interfering with the appointments that doctor has.

This edit command will take in a parameter INDEX which is a positive integer which references to the index of doctors shown on the screen.

Furthermore it will take in information that the specified doctor's information will be changed to.
This will create a new Doctor Object and transfer over all the information that isn't specified in the edit command to be the same as the original doctor.

#### Design consideration:

**Aspect: How the doctor object is going to be edited:**

* You can make it so that you change the value of the variables inside the original doctor
    * Pros: save space and improve space and time complexity
    * Cons: Risk introducing unexpected bug as Doctor is no longer immutable


## **Planned enhancements**

### Edit Appointment to include editing of Doctor details

#### Implementation

This enhancement will let the user edit the appointments associated doctor.

This edit command will take in a parameter INDEX which is a positive integer which references to the index of doctors shown on the screen.

Furthermore it will take in information that the specified doctor's information will be changed to.
This will then change the doctor associated with the appointment the user is editing.

#### Design consideration:

**Aspect: How the doctor is going to be edited:**

* Edit associated doctor based on INDEX shown on the present doctor list. e.g., `edit_appt /doc 2` will edit the doctor associated to the appointment to the second doctor displayed in the Doctor list.
    * Pros: Intuitive for clinic assistants to use
    * Cons: Might be difficult to implement

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
In the near future, we hope to be able to enhance our application as stated below.

### Allow different doctors to have appointment slots at the same timing

#### Implementation

Currently, different doctors cannot have the appointment slots at the same timing. This is done with the assumption that the GP clinic will only have one doctor and one room at any one time.
However, in the future, we hope to be able to allow different doctors to have appointment slots at the same timing. This will allow the clinic to have multiple doctors and rooms at the same time.

This enhancement will allow the user to add appointments with the same timing as long as the doctor is different.

The `view` Timeslots command will also be updated to show the available timeslots for all doctors.

To implement this, there has to be a check to ensure that the appointment timing does not clash with any other appointments for the same doctor when adding/editing appointments.

#### Design consideration:

**Aspect: How to ensure each doctor can only have 1 appointment for timeslot:**

* When a new appointment is added or edited, check if the appointment timing clashes with any other appointments for the same doctor.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Additional check required when adding/editing appointments.


### Change the tab to the corresponding tab of the command

#### Implementation

Currently, when a command is used, the tab the user is on will not switch to the corresponding tab of the command. E.g. if the user is on the `Doctors` tab, entering the `list` command
will not switch the user to the `Patients` tab. In the future, we hope to be able to implement this feature such that the user will be switched to the corresponding tab of the command.

This applies for all commands such as `list_appt`, `add`, `add_doctor`, `edit`, `edit_appt`, `delete`, `delete_doctor`, `delete_appt`, `find`, `find_nric`, `find_appt`, `view`, `appt`, `edit_appt` and `delete_appt`.

This enhancement will allow the user to be switched to the corresponding tab of the command.

This enhancement will improve the user experience as the user will not have to manually switch to the corresponding tab of the command.

#### Design consideration:

**Aspect: How to implement changing of tabs:**

* Create a method to switch to the corresponding tab of the command and call this method whenever a command is used.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Additional method required to switch tabs.


### Edit Appointment to include editing of Doctor details

#### Implementation

This enhancement will let the user edit the appointments associated doctor.

This edit command will take in a parameter INDEX which is a positive integer which references to the index of doctors shown on the screen.

Furthermore, it will take in information that the specified doctor's information will be changed to.
This will then change the doctor associated with the appointment the user is editing.

#### Design consideration:

**Aspect: How the doctor is going to be edited:**

* Edit associated doctor based on INDEX shown on the present doctor list. e.g., `edit_appt /doc 2` will edit the doctor associated to the appointment to the second doctor displayed in the Doctor list.
    * Pros: Intuitive for clinic assistants to use
    * Cons: Might be difficult to implement

### Display date in Timeslot tab even on first view call

#### Implementation

Currently, the date in the timeslot tab only appears after calling view command more than once. This is done in our previous release under the assumption that the first call of the command is not ambiguous.

However, in the future, we will change it to instantly display the date whenever we call the view command. This will help to improve user experience, increasing their confidence since date is always displayed.

This enhancement will enhance the user experience when using the view command and the timeslots tab.

To implement this, there needs to be a logic change in the front end of the view available command.

#### Design consideration:

**Aspect: How to ensure user is certain of the date of the available timeslots they are viewing:**

* Whenever a view command is called, display the date at the top of the timeslot tab, even for the first call.
    * Pros: Helps to make the user experience more smooth.
    * Cons: Difficult to implement.

### Change duration of each timeslot to smaller durations

#### Implementation

Currently, the duration of every timeslot is exactly 1 hour. This is done under the assumption that most appointments take 1 hour and to provide doctors with sufficient rest.

However, in the future, we will change it to variable timeslots which clinic assistants can choose depending on the type of appointment. This will help to improve efficiency of the clinic to be able to treat more patients in a day.

To implement this, there needs to be a back end change in the view available command where timeslots added will be in intervals of different durations.

#### Design consideration:

**Aspect: How to ensure clinic can cater to people of different appointment types:**

* Whenever a view command is called, display all time intervals which the doctor is free.
    * Pros: Clinic assistant can view the time interval and book the appointment as necessary.
    * Cons: Difficult to implement.

## **Appendix: Future Features**

### Edit Doctor

#### Implementation

This enhancement will let the user edit details of the doctor inside the clinic assistant without deleting or interfering with the appointments that doctor has.

This edit command will take in a parameter INDEX which is a positive integer which references to the index of doctors shown on the screen.

Furthermore, it will take in information that the specified doctor's information will be changed to.
This will create a new Doctor Object and transfer over all the information that isnt specified in the edit command to be the same as the original doctor.

#### Design consideration:

**Aspect: How the doctor object is going to be edited:**

* You can make it so that you change the value of the variables inside the original doctor
    * Pros: save space and improve space and time complexity
    * Cons: Risk introducing unexpected bug as Doctor is no longer immutable

## **Appendix: Effort**

The effort required for our team to finish this team project from start to finish was quite substantial. We faced many difficulties at every step and milestone, but in the end we overcame those challenges and prevailed.
The difficulty of this team project was quite high as there are a lot of unexpected challenges that came up. In the first few weeks it was quite smooth as we only had to figure out what kind of product we wanted to make and who we wanted to make it for.
Afterwards is where things get more challenging it turns out that refactoring existing code was more difficult than it seemed. An example, the Person Object needed to be changed to hold more information like nric.
This causes many of the existing test cases from AB3 to break. Another challenge was when we added another entity type class called Appointment. At first, it may seem like it would not be that hard to implement Appointment by referencing the code for the Person Object.
But when we arrived at the storage implementation we were stuck for quite a while. It was quite a challenge to figure out how we could store and reap the Appointment class reliably.

<br>

Although those experiences was frustrating at times, when we finally managed to finish a section, we felt a sense of achievement every single time.
One of these moments is when we managed to figure out how to read and write from the json file whe we added Appointments to the project. This achievement was one of the bigger milestone that we crossed  that helped with the implementations of future features.
For example, When the Doctor Object was added to the project it was definitely smoother as we already had experience before hand with appointments. This makes the implementation of Doctor slightly faster as we had overcame these challenges before.
Although the Doctor Object also came with challenges that are unique. This is because the Doctor Object has a deep interaction with the Appointment Objects making it a three-way connection between the three classes. This causes a lot of problems and bugs that took a lot of effort and was very difficult to solve due to the increasingly complex code.

<br>

Another unique challenge was the GUI of the project. Most of us are not familiar with javafx outside of ip before this, therefore we encountered difficulties not only in coding the gui, but alos coming up with the design of it.
We wanted to make it not too cluttered without sacrificing any of the feature we wanted to add. We then went through multiple iterations to figure out what was the best way to get the most out of the UI. We accomplished these eventually by using tab Panes that let
us have a good amount of information stored in the project without sacrificing the readability of it.

<br>

Testing and Debugging was one of the biggest challenges we encountered throughout this project. Debugging was extremely time consuming and so were finding bugs. We learned that we had quite alot of rrom for improvement during the PE-D. Thia
demo helped us realise things that we have overlooked before as a team. This was an extremely important experience for us as we were forced to not only fix the bugs each memeber is responsible for, but we also had to cooperate in debugging and testing each other's code. This
part of the project might be the most difficult and time consuming one as it took a lot of hours to finish and not a lot of time to spare. The moment when we realise that we had fixed most of the issues found during and after the PE-D was one of the biggest achievement in this project, as it signifies the end of this team project.

In conclusion, We learned a lot from this team project. Whether that was teamwork, coding, and time management. We struggled a lot at almost every step of the way, but we prevailed and came out of it as better programmers.
We learned a lot about various programming and software engineering practices and techniques like, testing, uml diagrams, user stories, defensive coding. By using everything that we learned this past semester we are able to come up with a good product with important features that prioritized the user's needs first.
